<!-- what  is bind in js -->

<!-- In JavaScript, the bind() method is a powerful tool that allows you to create a new function with a customized this context. Let’s dive into the details:

Function Borrowing:
With bind(), an object can borrow a method from another object. For instance, consider two objects: person and member.
The member object borrows the fullName method from the person object: -->

<!-- const person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    fullName: function () {
      return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
  };
  
  const member = {
    firstName: "Hege",
    lastName: "Nilsen"
  };
  
  let fullName = person.fullName.bind(member);
  console.log(fullName()); // Outputs: "Hege Nilsen" -->

<!-- The this keyword refers to an object, and its meaning depends on how it’s invoked -->
<!-- Remember, this is not a variable; it’s a keyword. You cannot directly change its value. The bind() method ensures that functions maintain their intended context, making it a valuable tool in JavaScript programming -->
